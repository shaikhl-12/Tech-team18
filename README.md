# Overview
In this project we have created a Climate_awareness game in mobile app by using react native and Expo CLI.

This app is designed to educate users about climate change through various interactive games and quizzes.

## Features

- Login functionality

# code: 
we have used codes from previous labs and sessions of our subject tech for mobile apps and utilized those codes as freference and done the project.


# Explanation:

We have created three games Bingo, and two others. one can choose any one game to play.

Firstly, User logins to app by entering the name of his/her. After that he chooses the game, what he wants to play .In background we have kept a beautiful nature photo,such that it attracts user to play and enjoy in the app.

For suppose if he choose vocabulary quiz; The questions will appear on the screen, if he selects any box such that it gets wrong or correct, If its get correct then +1 mark is awarded otherwise -1 mark is awarded.Based on the this thinking while answering questions, utilization of nature thoughts will raise in the mind of a person and such that one can get attracts to the questions and meanings of the environment which makes use of environment life very easy and sophisticated with a planning.

Furthermore,we have implemented the code in a way that if the question appeared on the screen was slected by user and it gets correct, then it was indicated by green color otherwise it goes to red color.
